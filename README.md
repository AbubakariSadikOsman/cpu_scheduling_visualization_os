# CPU Scheduling Visualisation

This project aims to create a visualization tool that will allow users to interactively explore and compare these different scheduling algorithms.The significance of this project lies in the impact it will have on improving users' understanding of CPU scheduling algorithms and their effects on system performance. By visually simulating and comparing different CPU scheduling algorithms, users will have a more intuitive grasp of how these algorithms work and be able to make informed decisions regarding which algorithm to implement in their own systems.
